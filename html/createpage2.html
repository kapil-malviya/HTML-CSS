 <h2> Gold as Commodity </h2>
<section>
<span>
  Gold. It's shiny, metallic, and melts easily into bars,<br>
  coins, or jewelry. It doesn't rust, corrode, or decay.<br>
  The main problem with gold is that, unlike other commodities<br>
  such as oil or wheat, it does not get used up or consumed.<br>
  Once gold is mined, it stays in the world. A barrel of oil,<br>
  on the other hand, is turned into gas and other products that <br>
  are expended in your car's gas tank or an airplane's jet engines.<br>
  Grains are consumed in the food we and our animals eat.<br>
  Gold, on the other hand, is turned into jewelry, used in art,<br>
  stored in ingots locked away in vaults, and put to a variety of other uses.<br>
  Regardless of gold's final destination,<br>
  its chemical composition is such that the precious metal cannot be used <br>up, it is permanent.<br>
