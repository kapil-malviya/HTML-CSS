 <h2> Gold as Commodity </h2>
 
 <p> Gold. It's shiny, metallic, and melts easily into bars, coins, or jewelry. It doesn't rust, corrode, or decay.</p>
 <p> The main problem with gold is that, unlike other commodities such as oil or wheat, it does not get used up or consumed.
 Once gold is mined, it stays in the world. A barrel of oil, on the other hand, is turned into gas and other products that 
 are expended in your car's gas tank or an airplane's jet engines. Grains are consumed in the food we and our animals eat.
 Gold, on the other hand, is turned into jewelry, used in art, stored in ingots locked away in vaults, and put to a variety of other uses.
 Regardless of gold's final destination,
 its chemical composition is such that the precious metal cannot be used up - it is permanent.</p>
